# 🌟 Setting Up Your Computer Like a Superhero! 🦸‍♂️

Hi there! Let's get your Mac ready to use some super cool computer tools! 🚀

## 🎮 Getting Your Computer Ready

### Step 1: Get the Magic App Store (Homebrew)
First, we need to get a special app store that helps us install cool computer tools. Ask a grown-up to:

1. Open the "Terminal" app (it looks like a black box with a white `>_` in it)
2. Copy and paste this magic spell into Terminal:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
3. Press the Enter key ⏎
4. Type in the computer's password when it asks (it's like a secret code!)

### Step 2: Install Python (The Snake Helper) 🐍
Now let's get Python (don't worry, it's not a real snake!):

1. In Terminal, type:
```bash
brew install python
```
2. Press Enter ⏎

### Step 3: Install Go (The Racing Car) 🏎️
Time to get Go (it's super fast, like a race car!):

1. In Terminal, type:
```bash
brew install go
```
2. Press Enter ⏎

### Step 4: Get the Special Tools 🛠️
Now we need some helper tools:

1. In Terminal, type:
```bash
pip install tqdm configparser
```
2. Press Enter ⏎
